    >> Div is a block level element ,span is inline element.
       Adding div will take some space,margins,but span will not.
       The div tag is used in HTML to make divisions of content on the web page like

            <pre style="font-size:large;">
            >> A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers 
               automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
               A block-level element always takes up the full width available. Ex : p and div.

               An inline element does not start on a new line.
               An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary. Ex : span
